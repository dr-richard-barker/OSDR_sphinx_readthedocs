^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**The search bar is a quick and easy way to filter through the data and can be used to create precise database queries.**

**OSDR provides users with a full-text search capability of the metadata for all datasets.**

Full-text search terms can be a single word or multiple words with either Boolean, wildcards (asterisks *), or string (text).


* Searches are case-insensitive concerning search term(s). To perform a search, enter a keyword or set of keywords, in the search box and either press ‘Enter’ or use your mouse to select the magnifying glass icon.

  * **Search bar example:** Search results can be sorted by relevance, release date, source, and title in ascending or descending orders. In addition, to see an overview of the study metadata, click on the image of a magnifying glass, (highlighted with a red dashed square) to show highlighted keyword search relevance.
  * Clicking on a study title will show all the detailed metadata for that study and provide further data and links or use the page navigator arrow(s) on the top right corner to go to the next page of search results.

Boolean Operator Options :raw-html-m2r:`<a href="#l33m3u35t1a7" id="l33m3u35t1a7"></a>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**How to make your search more insightful or precise using defined boolean operators.**

Please note that you may not use both the Boolean operators and double quotations together.

The resulting set is the same as searching for the terms ‘genome’ and ‘ecotype without the operator.


.. raw:: html

   <table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="190"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Operator</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>AND</td><td>ALL search terms must be present (default Boolean search)</td></tr><tr><td>OR</td><td>ANY of your search terms can be present</td></tr><tr><td>NOT</td><td>Exclude words from your search</td></tr></tbody></table>


**Double Quotation marks define search phrases as essential for a precise match requirement.**


* If multiple words are in double quotations, then those words must match exactly in the order given, as shown below:

  * **Quotation example:** Search results from searching the exact term “genome ecotype” by using quotation marks. In this example, no search results were due to a combination of keywords and Boolean operators that failed to match any sample in the database.

Boolean NOT operator. :raw-html-m2r:`<a href="#w4aeta4y960m" id="w4aeta4y960m"></a>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Refining search techniques to identify related studies.**


* Exclude studies containing the term(s) from your search using the minus prefix (-). This is the same as using the NOT operator which is the same as using the NOT operator.

  * **Not operator example:** Below is a search using the ‘NOT’ operator. genome ecotype –genotype.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**How to use AND operators to make your search more precise.**


* Require term(s) in your search using the plus prefix (+). This is the same as using the AND operator.

  * **An operator example:** genome sequencing +WS ecotype

**How to use a * wild card to find closely related studies.**


* Search on unspecified portions of the search terms using an asterisk (*)

  * **A *wild card Boolean operator example:** genome ecotype * Gravity. In this example, we identified 2 studies with samples that received variable quantities of gravity as a study factor.

Federating data sources :raw-html-m2r:`<a href="#id-86tmuz33uzle" id="id-86tmuz33uzle"></a>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**How to add an external database to your search.**

OSDA has integrated, commonly termed a data federation, with multiple heterogeneous external databases. Users can search across multiple databases in addition to OSDA. The links in the federated search results are to the authoritative external databases.

OSDA is currently federated with:


* `The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/>`_
* `The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) Proteomics Identification (PRIDE) <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/>`_
* `The Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) Metagenomics Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (MG-RAST) <http://metagenomics.anl.gov/>`_

The OSDA repository does not contain copies of the data sets found in the external databases, GeneLab maintains metadata records (e.g., information about the data) of the external data sets in federated databases. These records are automatically updated to keep the GeneLab database search content up to date with the external databases.

To search in one or all of these databases, enter text search term(s) and select the desired databases as shown below. Federated search results are then shown. You may change the database selection(s) at any time and the search results will be updated accordingly.


* In addition to searching the GeneLab Data Repository, federated data repositories can be included in the search.

  * **Example:** Below are examples of federated data repositories that can be searched.

If the user does not have a specific database in mind GeneLab and ALSDA are automatically selected, these options can be left on or turned off or they can also add NIH GEO, EBI PRIDE and AML MG-RAST to search.</em></p></figcaption></figure>


Study Search Filters :raw-html-m2r:`<a href="#id-5dnlxovdz6up" id="id-5dnlxovdz6up"></a>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**The filter box on the left can filter through the OSDR to find studies related to your expertise or interests.**

In addition, OSDR offers filters that facilitate the search process for related studies within the GeneLab repository. These filters encompass Project Type, Factors, Organisms, and Assay Types. The menu associated with each category contains pre-populated terms derived from datasets included in the OSDR repository. It is noteworthy that the use of these filters is possible without the inclusion of any additional search terms.


* After filter selection, the filter is immediately applied, potentially altering the number of search results displayed. Filter values are shown as text above the results as they are added. Multiple options from the same filter allow users to select more closely related studies.
* For instance, to filter your search, choose 'Spaceflight' from the 'Factors' menu, followed by 'RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)' and 'Seedlings' from the 'Tissue' menu. OSDR will search for studies that have either of these terms as factors.
* Users can change the filter terms they have selected by selecting the filter again from the drop-down menu or by clicking the "Clear" button. It is important to note that the "Clear" button only eliminates the filter conditions and does not erase any text search terms entered before the filters. In addition to keyword searches in the OSDA, users can also search using key factors from the metadata of the studies.

  * **Example:** Below is an example set of filters that can be used to identify studies with similar experimental designs.
