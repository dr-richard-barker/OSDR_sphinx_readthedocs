Single Study Metadata User Interface :raw-html-m2r:`<a href="#i4jh5wczhr02" id="i4jh5wczhr02"></a>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**There is a lot of information available through the OSDR so it is important to read the description of each experiment carefully.**

Study metadata are viewable through a tabbed user interface for each study (see below). Click on each tab to navigate through the different sections: Description, Protocols, Sample and Assay Tables, Publications, Study Files and for some processed studies transcriptional visualization.


* The “Description” tab provides an overview of the study including a text description, contact information, experimental factors, organism(s), type of assay(s), project or mission details, funding information and citation information.

  * **Description example:** The red box highlights the “Description tab” view that has selected an example dataset, OSD-37. Below is a series of buttons that allow the user to navigate through the data to find details of interest.

#. At the top of the page, you should be able to see an icon picture summarizing the model organism next to the study ID number and data release version #.
#. On the left of the screen, you’ll see a series of buttons that can quickly navigate you down to different sections.

   #. Description - An abstract summary of the experiment
   #. Experiment(s) - “No associated Experiments” is not uncommon
   #. Payload(s) - “No associated Payloads” is not uncommon
   #. Mission(s) - “No associated Mission” is not uncommon
   #. Protocol(s) - provides the names and detailed descriptions of the sample collection, library construction, assay, treatment and any other protocol(s).
   #. Samples - Table of metadata describing the sample's names including quantitive and qualitative metadata values describing how they were treated. Users can select which fields they wish to export and export them as .csv files for use as factors in new subsequent models.
   #. Assay(s) - Table of metadata linking the samples to quantitive and qualitative metadata about how they were processed. Users can select which fields they wish to export as .csv files that can be used as factors in downstream statistical models.
   #. Publication(s) - Title, Authors, PubMedID, DOI## and web link to papers associated with this study. These provide a first-hand account of the study from the researchers who conducted the primary study.
   #. File(s) - A directory showing the OSD archive data folders that contain the study metadata, the raw or processed data provided by the research team and any extra processed data created by the GeneLab team.
   #. Version History - Date of the release of the current version and any associated files that were updated.
   #. Visualization - Launches into a new tab in the browser and provides insights into the GeneLab studies with processed data. “No processed data” is not uncommon.

#. Scrolling down will allow you to a description of the study, the factor(s), organism(s), assay(s), and descriptions of the related project metadata.
#. There are a lot of different types of data that can be downloaded and used for further analysis and publication.

Selecting sample(s) data for export :raw-html-m2r:`<a href="#fjmk1199na87" id="fjmk1199na87"></a>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**The samples tab contains data that can be downloaded for new statistical analysis.**


* 
  The “Samples” and “Assays” tabs provide sample and assay level details formatted in a navigatable table. These tabs include specific organism characteristics, study factors and treatments, sample and sample processing metadata, assay execution parameters, and data processing metadata. Use the bottom navigation bar to scroll through all the columns, and the right margin scroll bar to navigate the rows.


  * **Sample example:** A OSD dataset, OSD-37, sample name tab and sort/filter functions. The select export column button in the top left corner allows the selection and download of the most important sample factors. Entries in the table with Blue text provide links to ontology databases to help define their meaning. In the bottom right corner the number of entries on the page is set to 25 as default, many studies have more samples, so you can either navigate through the samples with the arrow button(s) or increase the number of entries per page to 50 or >~100.

**Assay data tables can be exported from OSDR and saved or used on local or cloud-based computers.**


* Users can download selected columns from the Samples and/or Assays table. Click on the Select Export Columns button. Select the desired columns and click Export CSV or desired format.

  * **Assay example:** The OSDR dataset, OSD-37, the “select export columns” has been selected. The Export CSV can be seen at the center top of the table. The user can select which columns or “Fields” they’d like to download by selecting boxes next to the options. The button left corner has “select all”, “unselect all” and close buttons.

The File(s) tab provides raw and processed data :raw-html-m2r:`<a href="#m4rj3iwtu9j" id="m4rj3iwtu9j"></a>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**This resource allows you to access and download the raw and processed data.**


* The Study Files tab provides metadata and raw or processed study data files. Each row includes information about the size, type, and description. Click on the file name to download. You can download multiple files by clicking the checkbox at the left of the file name to select and then clicking the “Download Selected Files” button. To select all files in a resource category, navigate to the desired folder by selecting the folder name and then click on the checkbox at the top of the table, next to the Files column name.

  * **File example:** Study files view and sort/filter functions for OSDR dataset, OSD-37.
