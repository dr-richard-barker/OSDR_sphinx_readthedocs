`Open Science: <https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/about/opensci.html>`__\ The
NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) enables access to space-related
data from experiments and missions that investigate biological and
health responses of terrestrial life to spaceflight. The goal of OSDR is
to enable multi-modal and multi-hierarchical fundamental space life
science data, including ’omics, phenotypic, physiological, behavioral,
hardware, and environmental data, to be reused toward basic science,
applied science, and operational outcomes for space exploration and
knowledge discovery.

`ALSDA: <https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/about/alsda.html>`__ The `Ames Life
Science Data Archive <https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/about/alsda.html>`__
(ALSDA) provides public access to a wide range of data from
space-relevant experiments and missions, including physiological,
phenotypic, bioimaging, video, behavioral, hardware, and environmental
telemetry data. The goal of ALSDA is to enable the reuse of this
fundamental space life science data towards basic science, applied
science, and operational outcomes for space exploration and knowledge
discovery. ALSDA has recently been integrated into the NASA Open Science
Data Repository (OSDR), which also includes the NASA GeneLab and the
NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection, in order to improve
the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR)
of its data.

`GeneLab <https://genelab.nasa.gov/about>`__: GeneLab is a NASA project
that aims to facilitate information sharing, foster innovation, and
increase the pace of scientific discovery from rare and valuable space
biology experiments. It provides a comprehensive database that hosts a
growing collection of omics data generated from spaceflight and
spaceflight analog experiments, enabling scientists to upload, download,
store, search, share, transfer, and analyze this data. GeneLab’s primary
goal is to maximize the utilization of the valuable biological research
conducted in space by generating and publishing omics data, and it
includes a state-of-the-art sample processing and high-throughput
sequencing laboratory to process samples and raw data in a consistent
manner.

`BPS <https://nlsp.nasa.gov/explore/lsdahome/datarequest>`__: Explore
the `Space Biology Biospecimen Sharing
Program <https://nlsp.nasa.gov/explore/lsdahome/datarequest>`__ (BPS), a
program that facilitates the sharing of biological samples collected
during spaceflight experiments. Gain insights into the importance of
biospecimen sharing for advancing space biology research and
understanding the effects of space travel on living organisms. 

`NBISC <https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/about/nbisc.html>`__: `NASA Biological
Institutional Scientific
Collection <https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/about/nbisc.html>`__\ (NBISC), is
a biorepository contains tens of thousands of unused non-human samples
collected from NASA-funded spaceflight investigations and correlative
ground/analog studies. The purpose of NBISC is to receive, store,
document, preserve, and make the collection available to the scientific
community. 

`Latest News: <https://genelab.nasa.gov/newsarchive>`__ Stay up-to-date
with the latest news and developments in NASA’s space biology research.

`Publications: <https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/data/publications.html>`__\ ` <https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/data/publications.html>`__\ This
page contains links to literature related to the Open Science
Repository, a central hub for NASA’s open science publications. It
includes journal articles, reports, and other scientific documents that
have been made publicly available.

**AI/ML:** The “AI/ML” drop-down menu offers a link to the “AI4LS”
(Artificial Intelligence for Life in Space Working Group) page. This
working group brings together experts from NASA, academia, and industry
to explore the potential of AI and machine learning for advancing life
in space.

`AI4LS: <https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/data/ai4ls.html>`__ The AI4LS working
group focuses on utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning (ML) methods to analyze complex, heterogeneous, multi-modal
biological datasets. ML approaches have shown promise for deriving
meaningful patterns from these datasets and creating mathematical models
to fit patterns and minimize errors. The group aims to build ML models
to predict the physiological effects of spaceflight hazards using
multi-modal biological and environmental data. Focus areas include
causal inference, foundation models, and “self-driving” labs. Causal
inference aims to elucidate causal relationships in complex biological
data by combining invariance theory and ML methodology. Foundation
models are trained on large, broad datasets and then refined on smaller
datasets, which is relevant to space biology research due to limited
sample size and restricted problem space. Self-driving labs are
cutting-edge technology designed for space exploration. They employ
automation and cloud-based systems to collect data points in a
consistent and reproducible manner, leading to enhanced data acquisition
and analysis.

NASA seeks to transform science data management to increase research
throughput and transparency. The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has
issued new policies, including the Scientific Information Policy for the
Science Mission Directorate (SMD Policy Document SPD-41a). The
Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) division of SMD has further
specified these policies in the BPS Scientific Data Management Policy
(BPS-021). Guidance and aids on implementing these data management
policies are available at various locations, including the Space Biology
Open Science-Data Management Plan (OS-DMP) Template and Guidance, the
ROSES Open Science and Data Management Plan, and the NASA Science
